## Dependencies
The scripts in this repository are copied directly from the [factoritall](https://github.com/ekera/factoritall) repository, except for a few very minor adaptations.

The scripts implement the procedure from [[E21b]](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11128-021-03069-1) for completely factoring any integer efficiently in a single run of an order-finding algorithm, alongside supporting functionality. Our repository depends on this functionality.
